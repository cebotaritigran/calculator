# Calculator
This project is a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

## Using the Calculator
The calculator is very easy to use. Simply click on the buttons to enter the numbers and operators you wish to use in your calculation. The calculator will display the result of your calculation in the output area.

## Features
The calculator has the following features:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Clear button to reset the calculator
- Keyboard support for numeric keys and operators
## How it Works
The calculator uses JavaScript to perform the arithmetic calculations. When a user clicks on a number or operator button, the corresponding value is added to the input string. When the user clicks the equal button, the input string is evaluated and the result is displayed in the output area.

## Chalanges Faced
The biggest chalange was to chain all the operations without equal button which is still a problem and needs to be fixed, next thing would be doing operation orders.
